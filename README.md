Web scraping + data analysis project.

The goal is to practice data collection, cleaning, visualization, and learn how to apply machine learning and AI in the data field.

I divided the project into parts to focus on specific tasks while prioritizing code robustness.

- **Part 1:** Built a scalable scraper for [VivaReal](https://www.vivareal.com.br/) to collect rental data (price, size, rooms, bathrooms, parking).
- **Part 2:** Cleaned and visualized the data in Jupyter, exploring price patterns and common property features.
  
- **Part 3 (WIP):** Studying and applying a simple a machine learning model to predict rental prices based on collected features.
