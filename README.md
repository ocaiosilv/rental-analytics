# RENTAL ANALYTICS

- This project is a web scraping based analytics pipeline focused on exploring **Pandas** and **SQL integration** with dynamic data and visualization.

- My goal is to divide the project into parts so I can explore different tools, libraries, and their interactions.
The first part was to build a working and scalable web scraping script based on a real estate search site (my choice: https://www.vivareal.com.br/), since it's the most popular in my country).

**WIP â€“ Analytics & Visualization**
